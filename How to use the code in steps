Follow these steps to use the Google Apps Script Email Notification System:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Google Form

1. Create a new Google Form or open an existing one.
2. Ensure your form includes a question that captures the respondent's email address. The question title should be **exactly** `Email address` for the script to work correctly.

### Step 2: Open the Script Editor

1. In your Google Form, click on the three vertical dots (More) in the upper right corner.
2. Select **Script editor**. This will open the Google Apps Script editor.

### Step 3: Copy the Code

1. Copy the provided code from this repository.
2. Paste the code into the script editor, replacing any existing code.

### Step 4: Configure the Email Template

1. Open the **EMAIL_TEMPLATE_DOC_URL** variable in the script and replace the URL with the link to your Google Docs email template.
2. Customize the email template in Google Docs to suit your needs.

### Step 5: Set Up Triggers

1. In the Apps Script editor, click on the clock icon (Triggers).
2. Click on **Add Trigger**.
3. Choose the function `onFormSubmit` from the dropdown menu.
4. Set the event type to **On form submit** and click **Save**.

### Step 6: Test Your Setup

1. Submit a response to your Google Form.
2. Check the email address you provided to verify that the email notification has been sent successfully.
3. You can also check your Google Sheet for a status update indicating that the email was sent.

### Step 7: Monitor and Maintain

- Keep an eye on the Google Apps Script quotas and limits to ensure your script runs smoothly.
- Update the email template and script as needed for any changes in your project requirements.
