# Google Apps Script: Automate Unique ID Generation and Email Sending

This Google Apps Script automates the process of generating unique IDs for form responses, storing them in a Google Sheet, and sending an email to the respondent with a formatted email body using a Google Docs template.

---

## Steps to Use the Script

### 1. Set Up Google Sheet
1. Create a new Google Sheet.
2. Rename the first sheet to `Form Responses 1` (or adjust the script to match your sheet's name).
3. Add columns for the form responses. Ensure the data is captured starting from the first column. Add two additional columns for `Unique ID` and `Email Sent Status`.

### 2. Set Up Google Form
1. Create a Google Form and link it to the Google Sheet created in step 1.
2. Add fields for the respondent's email, name, and batch information.
3. Set the form's response destination to your Google Sheet.

### 3. Set Up Google Docs Template
1. Create a Google Docs template with placeholders like the following:
    ```
    Dear {name},

    Your unique ID is {uniqueId} for batch {batch}.

    Best regards,
    [Your Team]
    ```
2. Copy the documentâ€™s ID from its URL. For example, in the URL `https://docs.google.com/document/d/<DOC_ID>/edit`, the `<DOC_ID>` is the part to copy.

### 4. Deploy the Script
1. Open the script editor in your Google Sheet (`Extensions > Apps Script`).
2. Paste the provided script into the editor.
3. Replace `SHEET_ID` and `DOC_ID` in the script with the corresponding IDs of your Google Sheet and Google Docs template.

### 5. Set Up Triggers
1. In the script editor, go to `Triggers` (clock icon in the left-hand menu).
2. Add a new trigger:
    - **Function to run**: `onSubmit`
    - **Event source**: `From form`
    - **Type of event**: `On form submit`

### 6. Authorize the Script
1. When running the script for the first time or setting up the trigger, authorize it.
2. Follow the prompts and grant the necessary permissions.

### 7. Test the Setup
1. Submit a test response to your Google Form.
2. Check the Google Sheet for:
    - A unique ID generated in the `Unique ID` column.
    - The `Email Sent` status updated in the `Email Sent` column.
3. Verify that the email is received by the respondent with the correct formatted content.

### 8. Customize as Needed
1. Modify the email template or placeholders in the Google Docs template.
2. Adjust batch configurations in the `assignUniqueId` function to fit your requirements.

## Notes
- Ensure the Google Sheet and Docs template are in the same Google account where you deploy the script.
- If adding new batches, manually update the `BatchCounters` sheet or let the script append them dynamically.

## Troubleshooting
- If the script fails, check the logs in the Apps Script Editor under `Execution Logs` for errors.
- Ensure the form, sheet, and document IDs are correctly set in the script.
